# Introduction to Functions in Python

## What is a Function?
A **function** is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are used to organize code into smaller, manageable pieces and to avoid repetition.

## Why Use Functions?
1. **Code Reusability**: Write once, reuse multiple times.
2. **Modularity**: Break the program into smaller, logical sections.
3. **Improved Readability**: Functions make the code easier to understand.
4. **Easy Debugging**: Errors can be isolated to specific functions.
5. **Avoid Redundancy**: Helps prevent repeating code.

## Syntax of a Function
Functions are defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses, and a colon. The function body contains the code to be executed, and it's indented.

### Example:
```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # Function body
    return result
