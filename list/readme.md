## **What is a List?**

A **list** in Python is a collection of items that are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values. Lists are defined by placing items inside square brackets `[]`, separated by commas.

### **Examples:**
```python
# A list of integers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# A list of mixed data types
mixed_list = [1, "apple", 3.14, True]

# Nested lists
nested_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
